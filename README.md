# Personal Github Page

My plan for this page is to create a annotated directory of my projects on Github as well as a start page for my browser.

My start page was inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/55c3ax/i3_i_just_started_learning_html_and_css_and_made/)

Startpage Search Bar Commands:
`r <subreddit>` offers a quick way to go to a subreddit
`:def <query>` searches query at dictionary.com
`:wiki <query>` searches query at wikipedia.org
`:whoami` returns ip address through my [whoami project](https://github.com/stancheta/fcc-whoami)
`<site>.com` will redirect directly to a website
`:(` will redirect to [sadtrombone.com](https://www.sadtrombone.com/?autoplay=true)

Otherwise, the search bar will search the query at wherever site the dropdown menu is currently pointed at.
